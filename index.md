<h2>Background to the study</h2>
<p>
General practice is one of the cornerstones of the National Health Service but is currently under pressure as a result of a shortage of the workforce and an increasing number of people with long-term conditions who need regular care from General Practice and primary care. These pressures mean that it is essential to maximise the efficient organisation of staff teams in General Practice. There is a wide degree of variation in the organisation of staff teams, which traditionally include nurses, care assistants, receptionists, managers, and liaison with other community services. The general trend has been for practices to increase in size over time, to include a wider range of staff such as physiotherapists and pharmacists, with some combining to become ‘super-practices’ or federations. There is very little evidence to inform GPs and service commissioners what size or structure of practice, or what mix of professional staff, works best for team members and patients.</p>

<p>This research aims to provide evidence as to how the composition of GP teams and team climate affect the quality of care and health outcomes for patients, and the costs for practice. The study will involve: </p>
